# Project-DNA
Python simulation of DNA evolution under the Jukes-Cantor model, with L₁, χ², KL-divergence, and bootstrap analyses of convergence to uniform base frequencies.
This project investigates the stochastic dynamics of DNA sequence evolution under a simplified Jukes–Cantor model, combining biological background, mathematical modeling, and Python‐based simulation to illustrate how point mutations drive a finite sequence toward a uniform nucleotide distribution. Beginning with explanations based on cellular structure, DNA composition, and mutation mechanics, we formalize each nucleotide base as an independent Bernoulli trial with mutation probability μ per generation, and embed these trials within a discrete‐time Markov chain whose transition matrix assigns probability 1–μ to identity and μ/3 to each alternative base. We then detail core probability tools — Bernoulli, Binomial, and Categorical distributions — before constructing the Markov process, verifying irreducibility, aperiodicity, and ergodicity, and deriving its stationary distribution (uniform over {A, C, G, T}). Using Python functions for simulation and plotting, we generate synthetic DNA sequences, evolve them over successive generations, and compute nucleotide frequencies at each time step. To quantify convergence to uniformity, we calculate three distance metrics — L₁ distance, chi‐square statistic, and Kullback–Leibler divergence — and employ bootstrap resampling to obtain confidence intervals. Empirical results demonstrate that, for μ = 0.001, the nucleotide distribution falls within 1 % of uniformity (in L₁ norm) by approximately 2 500–3 000 generations.
